# Deep-Learning introduction:
  Deep learning define about working on complex neural networks. This topic is subset of machine learning.
  
### Types of layer in deep learning:
*input layer-receives raw data to machines 
*hidden layer-perform computation in hidden layer which process the data
*output layer-provide the final output and prediction on classification

### activation functions in deep learning:
1.ReLU:Rectified Liner Unit which is used to hidden layer to show data in gradients of data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of data.
2.sigmoid:map the values binary(0 and 1 in layer)
3.softmax:convert raw data score into probability on given data.

back propogation and optimisation:
In this propogration step we use some of example- mse(means standard error), cross entropy stop
